The aspect of the project is the implementation of drag-and-drop functionality using Framer Motion. I've utilized Framer Motion's capabilities to make the cards within the website draggable with smooth motion, enhancing the overall user experience. The beauty of Framer Motion is its convenience; with just a single line of code, I was able to introduce this dynamic feature.
I believe this project not only showcases my technical proficiency with React but also reflects my commitment to creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces. The learning process has been incredibly rewarding.
